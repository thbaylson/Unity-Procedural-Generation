# Procedural Generation Course Project

This repository contains work developed as part of the [Unity Procedural Generation: Build Infinite Game Levels](https://www.gamedev.tv/courses/unity-procedural-generation) course offered by GameDev.tv. The course focuses on creating dynamic 3D dungeon levels using procedural generation techniques in Unity.

## Learning Objectives

Throughout this course, I achieved proficiency in the following skills and concepts:

- **Procedural Dungeon Layouts**: Developed algorithms that generated unique dungeon layouts comprising interconnected rooms and hallways, creating varied and engaging experiences for each playthrough.

- **NavMesh Generation**: Automated the creation of navigation meshes, facilitating efficient pathfinding for AI agents within procedurally generated environments.

- **Dynamic Level Population**: Implemented methods for dynamically populating game levels with enemies and obstacles, significantly enhancing gameplay depth and challenge.

- **Advanced C# Programming**: Strengthened my C# programming skills by applying advanced concepts and adhering to best practices specifically tailored for procedural content generation.

- **Optimization Techniques**: Learned and applied optimization strategies for procedurally generated levels, ensuring high performance and smooth gameplay.
